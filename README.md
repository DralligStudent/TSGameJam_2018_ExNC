# TSGameJam_2018_ExNC
University Game Jam project. Sci-Fi fleet based JRPG.

When you upload the Unity project for the first time, remember to alter this:
-Project Settings -> Editor -> Version Control -> Mode: Visible Meta Files

(The other instruction, changing the Data Serialization to force text seems more like a preference.)
